            <h2>GENERAL</h2>
            <h5>Do ProCleaning's maids bring all necessary green cleaning supplies to get the job done?</h5>
            <p>ProCleaning provides green friendly products to give your home a great clean, aside from a vacuum, mop, bucket or stepstool. Please note that we don't typically abrasive cleaning solutions like Comet, Ajax, or bleach unless deemed necessary, but if you have them and want us to use them we will.</p>
            <h5>What if I only want common areas cleaned?</h5>
            <p>Make sure to register your apartment as a studio & make a note under "Special Instructions" that you only want common areas cleaned. You'll be charged a reduced rate.</p>
            <h5>What if you stay extra long to finish the job?</h5>
            <p>Unlike other services, ProCleaning has a service quote, not a time quote. This means that the cleaners will stay as long as they need to complete the clean at no additional cost.</p>
            <h5>Do I have to be home while you clean?</h5>
            <p>You do not have to be home for your clean as long as your cleaner has proper directions for entering and exiting your home. Please input these instructions when booking your appointment.</p>
            <h5>What if I'm not there to let the cleaning person in?</h5>
            <p>That's okay! Just leave us detailed entry instructions when you schedule your appointment online so we know how to gain access to your home. Your home will be locked according to your exit instructions when the cleaner leaves.</p>
            <h5>Will the same cleaner or maid show up for all my appointments?</h5>
            <p>If you're happy with your cleaner you had, we're happy to send them to all of your appointments. You just have to contact us to let us know and we'll make it happen.</p>
            <h2>SERVICES</h2>
            <h5>What if I just had renovation work done?</h5>
            <p>We provide a customized post-construction clean for these types of situations. Please call or email to coordinate this and receive pricing information.</p>
            <h5>Do I get a discount if I'm a frequent customer?</h5>
            <p>Yes, customers who sign up for recurring cleanings are entitled to significant discounts. </p>
            <h5>Can I give specific instructions to the cleaners and ask for special requests?</h5>
            <p>Yes, special instructions can be left for the cleaning professional when you schedule your appointment online. After the clean is complete, you can rate your ProCleaning experience and update your special instructions if you want something cleaned differently.</p>
            <h5>What if I don't have a mop, bucket, or vacuum?</h5>
            <p>Our cleaners bring a travel wet/dry mop that can be used on non-carpeted floors. If you do not have a vacuum and require one please let us know so we can bring one. Otherwise the cleaner will not be able to properly clean any carpeted floors.</p>
            <h5>Do you clean offices and other commercial spaces?</h5>
            <p>Not typically. However ProCleaning can handle any job no matter how big or small. We have special equipment and cleaners for these jobs. You can get a quote online, call us, or email.</p>
            <h2>BILLING</h2>
            <h5>When does my card get charged?</h5>
            <p>You will be sent an invoice via email on the day of your cleaning which can be paid via credit card. If you are receiving cleaning services on a continual basis you can save your card on file to be charged automatically.</p>
            <h5>What if I want a cleaner by the hour?</h5>
            <p>Our minimum appointment is a 2.5 hour appointment. If you would like to forego our standard pricing and hire an HOURLY cleaner, we can provide this at a cost of $35/hour if you email to coordinate the details.</p>
            <h5>How much does it cost?</h5>
            <p>ProCleaning pricing is based on the size of your home and the desired level of service. You can get a cleaning quote online to find the pricing for your specific needs.</p>
            <h5>What's your cancellation policy?</h5>
            <p>You are free to cancel your service at any time, however, we have a $50 SAME DAY CANCELLATION FEE which is charged if you cancel less than 4 hours prior to your scheduled appointment. If it is a specialty cleaning then you are charged 50% of the cleaning rate if you cancel less than 8 hours prior to your scheduled appointment.</p>
            <h5>Do I have to leave a tip?</h5>
            <p>Tips are not required but are certainly appreciated by our cleaners.</p>
